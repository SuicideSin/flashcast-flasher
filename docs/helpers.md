Helper functions
================

FlashCast provides helper functions which perform common operations and serve to
simplify your imager script so you can focus on developing your project rather
than writing scripts. Since new functions are likely to be added nearly every
release, any function reference in this repository would quickly become out-of-
sync and useless. For the canonical helper reference, please refer to the
function headers in FlashCast's `/usr/sbin/flash-image` script, the source of
which is available at

  https://github.com/tchebb/eureka_buildroot/blob/master/board/tchebb/eureka/fs-overlay_flasher/usr/sbin/flash-image

If you have written a function for one of your mods which you would like
to see included in FlashCast as a helper, please submit a pull request to
add the function to the file linked above.
